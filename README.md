## Architecture

The architecture of this project may seem unfamiliar to a seasoned Android developer
because I came up with an architecture that is tailored to the features of this project.
I took a web dev approach rather than over-engineering a Google scale solution where it feels
counter-productive.

Essentially the source of truth is SharedPref KV storage and, the Views get updated by observing the
changes.
It's kind of like a poor man's reactive system.

I've also heavily used Kotlin Extension Functions rather than Classes to help with the composition
to minimize the changes to a few places as possible.

## Build

1. Copy the properties from [local.example.properties](local.example.properties)
   to `local.properties` and provide the values
2. `üî® Make Project` or `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run` the app
